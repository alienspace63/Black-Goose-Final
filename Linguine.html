You can make it lactose-free by substituting a dairy-free margarine (we like Earth's Balance) for the butter. (Unfortunately, butter is better.) This recipe serves 2.</p><ul>2 cans chopped clams (tuna-sized cans)<br>1/2 head of garlic, chopped fine<br>1 shallot, chopped fine<br>2-3 T. butter (or margarine)<br>1/2-3/4 c. dry white wine (like Sauvignon Blanc)<br>1/2 lb. linguine<br></ul><ol><p>1. Get the water boiling for the linguine. Generously salt the water so the pasta has flavor of its own.<br>2. Open the cans of clams and use the lid to squeeze out the liquid into a 2-cup measuring cup. Set the clams aside You usually get about 1 1/2 cups of liquid. Add wine to the liquid until you have a total of 2 cups liquid.<br>3. In a high-sided, large skillet, saute the shallot in 2 T. butter until translucent. Add the garlic (<em>the more the better</em>) and saute until fragrant, but not brown (<em>just under a minute.</em>)<br>4. Add the clam juice and wine to the shallots and garlic. Turn the heat to medium high until the mixture boils. Continue boiling until the liquid has reduced by half.<br>5. Turn down the heat and add the reserved clams. At roughly the same time, add the pasta to the water and cook until al dente. About 9 minutes later, the pasta should be done and the clams will be warmed through.<br>6. Taste the clam sauce and add salt and pepper to taste. If you're using butter, add one last tablespoon or two to bind the sauce (<em>if you're using margarine, don't bother.</em>)</li></p></ol><p><a href="About.html">About Jen's Kitchen</a></p><p><a href="Jen's Kitchen.html">Back to Jen's Kitchen</a></p></body></html>
