I've already shared this popular recipe with many of my friends. The best thing is it's <em>so easy</em> to make!</p><ul>1/4 c. dry sherry2 T. soy sauce<br>2 T. vegetable oil<br>2 t. dry mustard<br>3-4 T. freshly minced garlic<br>1 to 2 lbs salmon filets</ul><ol><p>1. Mix together first 5 ingredients in a shallow dish. Place the cleaned and de-boned salmon filets face down in the mixture and allow to marinate for 1/2 to 1 hour. (<em>Tip, I cut a large piece of salmon into the serving sizes before marinating so the marinade can coat the sides of each piece as well.</em>)<br>2. Preheat the broiler. Transfer filets to a baking sheet, skin-down. Broil the salmon on the top rack for 7 to 9 minutes, or until done to your liking (<em>I like it still pink in the center.</em>)<br>3. I usually serve this with an aromatic rice and a lightly seasoned stir fry.</p></ol><p><a href="tapenade.html">Go to the tapenade recipe</a></p><p><a href="Jen's Kitchen.html">Back to Recipes</a></p></body></html>
